1. I/O
2. General Dij class (and just call different functions for the PQ), but have the same class
3. we can do a seperate thing for a PQ algo

With a general PQ function
we can easily do
idea 1:Adj list
idea 2:heappq
Idea 3:D-heap
Compare times for
    3.1 3
    3.2 4
    3.3 5
    3.4 6
idea 4:Fib-heap (actually really easy to do, just import it)
